 - Goal: You will be querying this publicly available synthetic dataset on Google BigQuery. To examine the files and describe the schema (e.g., field data types and table linkages) in the context of data-driven research for a medical condition of interest

 - Data: You will be working with an OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) v6 dataset. The SynPUF Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) OMOP dataset is a synthetic OMOP dataset based on Medicare insurance claims from 2008-2010 in the United States. Insurance claims are derived from medical care services provided by health systems to Medicare and Medicaid recipients; hence, consider that claims data are derived from records logged in health system electronic medical records systems.
